                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Parth Rana</strong>, a 3rd-year <strong>Information Technology
                        Engineering</strong> student with a strong focus on backend development. With a foundation built
                    on both a diploma and a degree in IT, I have hands-on experience in programming, database
                    management, and Android development. During my diploma, I worked on several Android projects, where
                    I developed my problem-solving skills and gained a solid understanding of software development
                    principles.</p>

                <p>I am proficient in <strong>PHP</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and <strong>SQL</strong>, and I am
                    continually expanding my knowledge in backend technologies. Currently, I’m delving deeper into
                    database connectivity with Python, which I’m excited to incorporate into future projects.</p>

                <p>Coming from a humble background, I’m driven to achieve my goals and make a significant impact in the
                    tech industry. I aim to become a highly successful developer within the next five years,
                    contributing to innovative and scalable solutions.</p>

                <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio—please feel free to explore my projects and get in touch!</p>

                <h3>Life-Saver (Web Application)</h3>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The ‘Life Saver’ application offers a multitude of features and services,
                    primarily centered around organ and blood donation services. This application facilitates blood
                    donations, allowing donors to both give and receive blood, while also organizing blood campaigns. In
                    the event of an emergency requiring blood transfusion, this application proves particularly useful,
                    ensuring that patients receive the necessary blood type. Additionally, the application offers organ
                    donation services. It also provides information on the nearest blood bank and their current stock of
                    blood, making it easier for people to find the required blood bank. Shortly, we plan to integrate a
                    fundraising module, which will allow us to raise funds and allocate them to those in need of medical
                    treatment but who lack the necessary financial means.</p>

                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong><br>
                    Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML<br>
                    Back-End: Java, PHP, Firebase</p>

                <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web Application Features:</strong>
                        The web application is mainly focused on blood banks and admin management because managing the
                        platform from a small screen is not feasible. Hospitals and blood banks typically manage their
                        departments using computers.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Supports Light & Dark theme.</li>
                            <li>Uses MD5 hashing for secure password storage.</li>
                            <li>Protects against SQL Injection attacks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Android Application Features:</strong>
                        The Android app is designed for users, as Android is widely used worldwide, and mobile apps are
                        more convenient for everyday use than a website.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tip of the day feature.</li>
                            <li>Search & Voice Search functionality.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The application streamlined the process of managing student data, reducing
                    the time needed for data retrieval and updates.</p>
